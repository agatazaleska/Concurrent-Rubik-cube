# Concurrent-Rubik-cube

## Project description

This is a project task for "Concurrent Programming" course at University of Warsaw, the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, 2021/2022. I do not own the idea for this project.

The project simulates Rubik's cube rotations.
The classic cube's design allows for simultaneous rotation of some layers (the ones without any common blocs)

In the src folder, a Rubik's Cube simulation has been implemented that allows for concurrent execution of layer rotation operations and displaying the current state of the cube.

The src folder also contains a unit test class for the cube.
