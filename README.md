## Concurrent-Rubik-cube

# Project description

The project simulates Rubik's cube rotations.
The classic cube's design allows for simultaneous rotation of some layers (the ones without any common blocs)

In the src folder, a Rubik's Cube simulation has been implemented that allows for concurrent execution of layer rotation operations and displaying the current state of the cube.

The src folder also contains a unit test class for the cube.
